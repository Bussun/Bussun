### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Bussun, just a random guy learning how to code in several languages (as of right now JavaScript, C# and C).
I spend my time ~~well, at school since I'm one of the few who actually likes it~~ on creating some small web applications
and my biggest project is a text editor for Super Mario Galaxy (not yet open source). You can reach me on Discord (#0586)
(btw I don't see why you would but if you need to)
