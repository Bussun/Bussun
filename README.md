### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Bussun, just a random guy learning how to code in several languages.
I spend my time ~~well, at school since I'm one of the few who actually likes it~~ on creating some small web/mobile applications
and my biggest project is a text editor for Super Mario Galaxy. You can reach me on Discord (#0586)
(btw I don't see why you would but if you need to)

Currently learning:
 - JavaScript
 - React
 - Flutter/Dart
 - C
 - C#
 - C++
