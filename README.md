### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Bussun, just one of the many devs you can find out there.
I spend my time ~~well, mostly at the university and~~ on creating some software
and my biggest project is a text editor for Super Mario Galaxy. I also make some web apps!

Currently learning/practicing:
 - Web development (HTML/CSS/JS + frameworks and related tools like webpack/react and more)
 - C
 - C#

If you'd like to contact me, you'll find everything you need soon on my new website.
